# 📊 Bike Store Data Analysis Project

This project explores a **Bike Store dataset** using SQL-style analysis inside Jupyter Notebook to understand sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and store revenue insights.  
It follows a structured and analysis-focused workflow including data cleaning, queries, visualizations, and insights.

## ✅ Project Overview

The notebook answers several key business questions, such as:

- Which products and categories generate the highest revenue?
- Which staff members perform best?
- Which stores drive the most sales?
- How many new customers join each month?
- What are the revenue trends across months and days?
- Which products are fast-moving or high-discount but still selling well?

Each analysis includes:
1. ✅ A styled markdown explanation  
2. ✅ SQL-like query stored in a DataFrame  
3. ✅ Visualizations (where useful)  
4. ✅ Final insights summarizing results
