🚴‍♂️ Bike Store Sales Analysis (SQL + Python)

This project performs an in-depth analysis of a Bike Store database using MySQL, Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
It explores sales trends, customer behaviour, staff performance, product categories, and store-wise revenue contribution with SQL-powered insights visualized in Jupyter Notebook.

✅ Project Overview

This analysis answers key business questions about:

Best-selling products

Revenue trends across stores

Customer purchasing patterns

Staff performance

Category-wise sales

Monthly revenue trends

High discount but well-selling products

Fast-moving vs low-stock items

Return/cancellation rate

The results help a retail bike store understand what sells, when it sells, and why it sells.
